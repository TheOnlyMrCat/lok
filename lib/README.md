# External libraries

These files are external libraries that I use in my code. None of the code in these libraries was created by me, however,
I have removed a number of files from the `plog` directory. These libraries are excluded from my repository's license,
and are instead licensed under the licenses which can be found on their respective repositories, which I have linked to
in this document.
