# Clok â€“ Compiler for the Lok programming language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheOnlyMrCat/lok.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheOnlyMrCat/lok)

This is a compiler for a programming language I am making called lok. Its goal is to have its syntax be as logical
as possible. For now, snippets of the planned syntax can be seen in the
[test](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/lok/tree/master/test) folder.
